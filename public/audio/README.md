## Required Files

To enable the music controller functionality, please add the following files:

   - Amazon Music
   - Google Play Music

2. **Extract from CD:**
   - Purchase "The Great Gatsby" soundtrack CD

3. **Legal music conversion services:**
   - Use services that convert from legally purchased music

## File Specifications
